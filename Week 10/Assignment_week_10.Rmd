# FILL IN THE CODE BELOW and review the outputs
#1 Which of these functions is a tidyverse function?
kings1 <- read.csv("data/kings.csv")  
kings2 <- read_csv("data/kings.csv")  
kings3 <- read.csv2("data/kings.csv")  
kings4 <- read_csv2("data/kings.csv")  
read_csv() and read_csv2() is a part of the tidyverse-package (specifically readr).
read.csv() and read.csv2() belongs to base R.

#2 What is the result of running class() on the kings object created with a tidyverse function
class(kings1)
The answer is [1] "data.fram"

#3 How many columns does the object have when created with these different functions?
kings1 <- read_csv2("data/kings.csv")  
kings2 <- read_csv2("data/kings.csv")  
kings3 <- read_csv2("data/kings.csv")  
kings4 <- read_csv2("data/kings.csv")  
kings has 11 columns. We found out by using _csv2(), We used this because the file contains ";"

#4 Show the dataset so that we can see how R interprets each column
glimpse(kings1)
View(kings1)

kings <- read_csv2("data/Danish_kings.csv")
class(kings)
glimpse(kings)

#Calculate the duration of reign for all the kings in your table
kings <- kings %>%
  filter(!is.na(start_reign) & !is.na(end_reign))
kings <- kings %>%
  mutate(duration = end_reign - start_reign)
glimpse(kings)

#Calculate the average duration of reign for all rulers
average_duration <- mean(kings$duration, na.rm = TRUE)
print(average_duration)
The answer is 20.2 years

#With Tidyverse
kings %>%
  summarise(avg_duration = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE))
20.2 years

#How many and which kings enjoyed a longer-than-average duration of reign?
long_reign_kings <- kings %>%
  filter(duration > average_duration)
long_reign_kings %>% count()
print(long_reign_kings)
24 kings enjoyed a longer-than-average duration of reign

#How many days did the three longest-ruling monarchs rule?
top_3_kings <- kings %>%
  arrange(desc(duration)) %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  mutate(days = duration * 365.25)
print(top_3_kings)
glimpse(top_3_kings)
21915.00+18993.00+15705.75
56613 days
